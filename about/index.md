I have always been a maker. For most of my career this has been in the physical world but in the last few years I have become ever more intrigued by the possibility of making in the digital world. In response to this I enrolled in General Assemblyâ€™s Web Development Immersive Course. Having gained a wealth of knowledge and a love for coding I now wish to pursue a career as digital maker in a creative web development team.
