HTML - CSS - Ruby on Rails - AngularJS - Skeleton CSS Framework

Whilst working as a designer I was regularly asked to create moodboards either to share ideas with other creatives or to convey early ideas to clients. For this final project I wanted to create an app which allowed designers to create moodboards digitally. To create the app I used Ruby on Rails to build the back-end. For the front-end I used Angular and made use of the interact.js package to allow users to dynamically control the placement of items on their moodboards.

Not only did this project allow me to practice the newer languages we had learnt but also helped me cement the non-coding skills such as project planning, research and finding solutions or answers to my questions online. This has left me with real confidence in my ability to complete projects beyond the course. With all the skills I have gained I am excited to expand this project now the course has ended.
