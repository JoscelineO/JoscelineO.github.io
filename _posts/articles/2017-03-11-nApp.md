HTML - CSS - Node.js - Mongoose - Express - AngularJS - Skeleton CSS Framework

This project was my first experience of developing as part of a team. My group chose to create an authenticated MEAN stack app which allowed users to log their dreams and if they wished display them alongside their sleep data sourced from the FitBit API. This project was a great chance to put into practice the agile working practices we had been introduced to and to learn new problem solving techniques from our teammates.
