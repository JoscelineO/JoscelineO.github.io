For a long time I have been interested in how people's emotions can be influenced by the things they interact with. With this in mind I wanted to create a game which was absorbing whilst also being visually calming.

Fade was a game which tested peoples ability to temporarily store information and adapt it dependent on new information given to them. Visually a colour faded onto the full screen and faded out leaving spots in that colour and others. The aim was for the user to click only on the colour they had just been shown. As a first project it was exciting to be able to explore what I could achieve with the early knowledge I had gained.
